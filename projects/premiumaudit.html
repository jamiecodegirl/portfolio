    <h4>About the Project</h4>
    <p>This portfolio piece is based on a project I worked on for Employers Insurance Group (NYSE:EIG). Employers is a Worker's Compensation Insurance Carrier for small businesses in the United States.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Project Timeline</h4>
    <div class="flex">

    <h4>Interesting Facts</h4>
    <p>The project team used Agile Scrum Methodology through the project lifecyle. I was the <span class="black">sole User Experience Designer</span>, and participated in all scrum ceremonies and workshops.</p>
    <p>The project team included approximately 10 team members across 3 U.S. timezones. I worked both remotely and from the company's office in Kansas City, MO.</p>

    <div>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>Lola wishes she could teach more classes, instead of spending so much time managing her business.</p>
      <h4>Expectations</h4>
        <p>Lola is tech-savvy, but she expects her insurance company to provide her easy-to-use software to complete required tasks.</p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>Lola tries to extend the benefits of her yoga &amp; meditation practice into all aspects of her life, but it can be challenging to stay centered when technical problems arise.</p>
      <h4>Frustrations</h4>
        <p>Lola's time is valuable, so she gets frustrated when software programs don't work as promised, or when she has to wait on hold to get help from customer service.</p>
      <h4>Needs</h4>
        <p>Lola needs an application that makes it easy to <span class="black">complete the dreaded end-of-year audit</span> on her insurance policy premiums.</p>
